## NFHS

Over 130 indicators for 5th survey and 107 indicators for 4th survey. Indicators are not necessarily unique across categories but with a little tweak this should be no problem

eg. https://chartify.in/india/nfhs/women-who-have-ever-used-internet
eg. https://chartify.in/india-states/madhya-pradesh/nfhs/women-who-have-ever-used-internet
eg. https://chartify.in/india-districts/madhya-pradesh/indore/nfhs/women-who-have-ever-used-internet

Other options such as year and typology can be selected from front end.

## NCRB

Basically all crime statistics go here.. Can't think of sub-categories rn but I believe it will be similar to indicators logic from NFHS

eg. https://chartify.in/india/ncrb/violence-against-women
